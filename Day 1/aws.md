# What AWS IAM ?  

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 ### With IAM, you can manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. IAM provides the infrastructure necessary to control authentication and authorization for your AWS accounts.


 ## Users-> Identity Center is enabled. We recommend managing workforce users' access to AWS accounts and cloud applications in Identity Center.


 ## User groups-> A user group is a collection of IAM users. Use groups to specify permissions for a collection of users.

 ## Roles -> An IAM role is an identity you can create that has specific permissions with credentials that are valid for short durations. Roles can be assumed by entities that you trust.

 ## Policies -> A policy is an object in AWS that defines permissions.
  
## User -> access key-> If you lose or forget your secret access key, you cannot retrieve it. Instead, create a new access key and make the old key inactive.
