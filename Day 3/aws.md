Estimating the cost for your **end-to-end DevOps project** using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for the **Spring Boot backend** and **Amazon ECS** for the **Flutter frontend**, targeting **5,000 to 10,000 users**, can vary based on multiple factors such as instance types, usage patterns, and data transfer. Below is a detailed breakdown of the estimated monthly costs for each component involved in your architecture.

### **Estimated Monthly Cost Breakdown**

### **Total Estimated Monthly Cost**

| **Total**                           | **Estimated Monthly Cost (USD)** |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Elastic Beanstalk**               | $48                              |

| **Total Estimated Cost**            | **$182.62**                      |

### **Key Considerations**
1. **Instance Types**: The costs can vary significantly based on the EC2 instance types chosen for Elastic Beanstalk and RDS.
2. **Scaling**: If you plan to use auto-scaling features for either ECS or Elastic Beanstalk, costs can increase during peak usage.
3. **Data Transfer**: If your application generates more outbound data, this can affect the overall cost.
4. **Load Balancing**: Using additional load balancers for ECS might also incur extra costs.

### **Conclusion**
The total estimated monthly cost for your AWS infrastructure for the **end-to-end DevOps project** is approximately **$182.62**. 









To optimize costs for your **end-to-end DevOps setup** on AWS while still targeting **5,000 to 10,000 users**, consider the following strategies to reduce expenses across your architecture. Below is a revised approach with cost-saving measures:

### **Cost-Reduction Strategies**

1. **Choose Smaller EC2 Instances**:
   - Instead of **t3.medium**, consider using a smaller instance type (e.g., **t3.micro** or **t3.small**) for both Elastic Beanstalk and RDS, particularly if your applications can run efficiently on lower specifications.
   - This can lead to significant savings.

2. **Use AWS Fargate Sparingly**:
   - Limit the number of concurrent tasks running in **ECS** and use a smaller configuration (e.g., 0.5 vCPUs and 1 GiB RAM) when possible.
   - Only run tasks that are necessary for handling peak loads.

3. **Optimize RDS Usage**:
   - Choose **RDS Aurora Serverless** if applicable, which automatically scales based on demand and can save costs during low usage.
   - Use lower-tier database instances (e.g., **db.t3.micro**) for development or testing environments.

4. **Leverage Spot Instances**:
   - Use **Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads or batch processing, which can save up to 90% compared to on-demand pricing.

5. **Implement Auto-Scaling**:
   - Set up auto-scaling for both Elastic Beanstalk and ECS to ensure you are only using the resources you need during peak times and scale down during off-peak times.

6. **Reduce Data Transfer Costs**:
   - Minimize unnecessary data transfer between services and optimize your application to reduce bandwidth usage.

7. **Limit CloudWatch Metrics**:
   - Use basic monitoring instead of detailed monitoring for your resources to keep CloudWatch costs lower.

8. **Utilize AWS Free Tier**:
   - If applicable, take advantage of AWS Free Tier offers for your first 12 months, which may include certain services free of charge.
