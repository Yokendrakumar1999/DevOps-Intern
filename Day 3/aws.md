### **Key Considerations**
1. **Instance Types**: The costs can vary significantly based on the EC2 instance types chosen for Elastic Beanstalk and RDS.
2. **Scaling**: If you plan to use auto-scaling features for either ECS or Elastic Beanstalk, costs can increase during peak usage.
3. **Data Transfer**: If your application generates more outbound data, this can affect the overall cost.
4. **Load Balancing**: Using additional load balancers for ECS might also incur extra costs.

### **Conclusion**
The total estimated monthly cost for your AWS infrastructure for the **end-to-end DevOps project** is approximately **$182.62**.
