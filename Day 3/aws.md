  - **Purpose**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute the Flutter frontend globally with low latency.
  - **Cost**: 
    - Data Transfer: $0.085 per GB (for the first 10 TB).
    - **Monthly Estimate**: $4.25 (assuming ~50 GB data transfer).

#### **2. Backend (Spring Boot)**
- **Amazon EC2**
  - **Purpose**: Runs the Spring Boot application.
  - **Instance Type**: **t3.medium** (2 vCPUs, 4 GiB RAM).
  - **Cost**: 
    - $0.0416 per hour.
    - **Monthly Estimate**: ~$30.00 (24/7 operation).

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)**
  - **Purpose**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
  - **Cost**: 
    - $0.0225 per hour + $0.008 per LCU.
    - **Monthly Estimate**: ~$16.20 (based on usage).

#### **3. Database (Amazon RDS)**
- **Amazon RDS**
  - **Purpose**: Manages the relational database for the backend (MySQL or PostgreSQL).
  - **Instance Type**: **db.t3.medium** (2 vCPUs, 4 GiB RAM).
  - **Cost**: 
    - $0.0416 per hour.
    - **Monthly Estimate**: ~$30.00 (24/7 operation).

- **Storage**: 
  - **Type**: General Purpose SSD.
  - **Size**: 20 GB.
  - **Cost**: $0.115 per GB.
  - **Monthly Estimate**: $2.30.

#### **4. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**
  - **Purpose**: Provides monitoring for EC2, RDS, and application logs.
  - **Cost**: Basic monitoring included in the free tier; estimate ~$5 for additional logs and metrics.

#### **5. Domain Management**
- **Amazon Route 53**
  - **Purpose**: Manages domain name registration and routing of user traffic to the application.
  - **Cost**: 
    - Hosted Zone: $0.50 per month.
    - DNS Queries: $0.40 per million queries (assuming ~1 million).
    - **Monthly Estimate**: $0.90.

### **Total Estimated Monthly Cost Breakdown**

| **Service**                     | **Estimated Cost (USD)** |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Amazon S3 (Storage)             | $0.0023                  |
| Amazon CloudFront                | $4.25                    |
| Amazon EC2 (Backend)            | $30.00                   |
| Elastic Load Balancer            | $16.20                   |
| Amazon RDS (Instance)           | $30.00                   |
| Amazon RDS (Storage)            | $2.30                    |
| Amazon CloudWatch                | $5.00                    |
| Amazon Route 53 (Hosted Zone)   | $0.50                    |
| Amazon Route 53 (DNS Queries)   | $0.40                    |
| **Total Estimated Cost**         | **$89.77**               |

### **Scalability and Cost Efficiency Considerations**
- **Auto Scaling**: Set up auto-scaling for EC2 instances to automatically adjust the number of instances based on traffic, ensuring high availability and cost efficiency.
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: Helps manage the incoming traffic efficiently, preventing downtime during high traffic periods.
- **Spot Instances**: Consider using spot instances for non-critical workloads to save costs on EC2.
- **Route 53**: Use routing policies (e.g., latency-based routing) to improve user experience and reduce latency.

### **Conclusion**
This setup is designed for a scalable and efficient architecture to handle up to **10,000 users** while maintaining cost-effectiveness. The estimated monthly cost of approximately **$89.77** gives you a solid foundation for your application. Adjustments can be made based on actual usage patterns and traffic, ensuring you stay within budget while optimizing performance.
